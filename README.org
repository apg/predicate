#+Title: Predicate: A library for testing things

* Overview / History

Predicate was an important library for the Combosaurus recommendation
engine. It allowed us to further filter out search results that didn't
quite fit the criteria. 

One could build a query in the MsgPack RPC call for "get_recommendations"
and ensure that filtering was done correctly. 

This was written in 2012.

* Installation

I have no idea if this compiles on anything after Go 1.0, which is what it
ran on.

* Usage

See the tests
